#Defintion of the pipeline in Jenkins
#All valid Declarative Pipelines must be enclosed within a pipeline block, for example:
pipeline {

    #The agent section specifies where the entire Pipeline, or a specific stage, 
    #will execute in the Jenkins environment depending on where the agent section is placed. 
    #The section must be defined at the top-level inside the pipeline block, but stage-level usage is optional.

    #any means:
    #any - Execute the Pipeline, or stage, on any available agent. For example: agent any
    agent any 

    #Defintion of Stages in Jenkins
    stages {

        #Defintion of stage in Jenkins
        #Name of the stage - "Stage 1"
        stage('Stage 1') {

            #Definton of steps thats executed in Jenkins

            steps {
                echo 'Hello world!' 
            }
        }
    }
